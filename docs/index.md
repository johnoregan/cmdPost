## What Is cmdPost?

cmdPost (pronounced &ldquo;Command Post&rdquo;) is a
[WordPress.com][wp] blogging client run from the [Windows] command line (cmd prompt).

cmdPost is capable of creating new blog posts, or updating existing ones. In the
latter case, only the details that have changed since the last update will be
uploaded.

cmdPost enables you to keep a copy of your blog posts on your local system. This
allows you to edit posts offline and upload the changes later. It also has the
advantage of making it easier for you to migrate from one blog host to another,
or to post to multiple blogs at once.
